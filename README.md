Task 1 - This project implements a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices using square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms. It includes data preprocessing and evaluation using MSE and RÂ² score with Scikit-learn. A foundational example of real estate price prediction, it offers scope for enhancements and deployment.
Task 2 - This K-means clustering model aims to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchasing patterns and behavior. This segmentation allows the business to understand customer groups better, enabling tailored marketing strategies and personalized services.
